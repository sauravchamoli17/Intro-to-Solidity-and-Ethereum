## Ethereum the world computer

- Ethereum is a POS(Proof of Stake) blockchain with 500K+ validators. 1 million transactions happens daily on ethereum and during bull run events it is upto 10 million. It has community of thousands of researchers and developers.

- Ethereum has EVM which is turing complete. Turing completeness means a system or language can perform any computation, simulate other systems, and has loops, conditionals, unbounded memory, and arbitrary precision.

- Solidity and Vyper are popular high-level programming languages specifically designed for Ethereum smart contract development. In contrast, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) operates at a lower level and directly executes low-level instructions called opcodes.
